So...I graduated this weekend! Woo! Fun!

I don't think it has truly hit me yet.  I think that I'm going to wake up someday relatively soon and be like 

> ...it's finally over...

All dramatic like. And then I'll keep on keeping on like I am right now.

I guess I should feel upset about the whole virus business cramping my style.  I'm sure I'll be upset when I see my diploma. But in the meantime, I'll power through.  We're all in this together.

Totally unrelated but also kinda related; I had a senior send-off meeting that would have probably been fine and not awkward for me if my **entire family** were not watching the meeting.  Not that I'm embarrassed by them but if you get a group of electrical / computer engineers in a room, there's a lot of silence and it kinda reflects on me? IDK I'm self conscious and not a fan of cringe content.
