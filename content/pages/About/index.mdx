_sidereal_ means ["relating to, or expressed in relation to starts or constellations: astral"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sidereal), and just like the definition, this blog is going to be pretentious and melodramatic. It's kinda like a tumblr, but nobody knows about it and there's absolutely no interaction with readers, i.e. much better.

sidereal is a test bed for small React components, programming tutorials (coming soon hopefully!), and other written works.

I hope you enjoy!
